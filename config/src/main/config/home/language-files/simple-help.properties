#Content
simple.field.help.dc-title=The title for the research dataset/collection, registry/repository, catalogue or index. It is recommended for datasets and collections, the title should be unique to the data, ie. do not use the publication title as the data title.

This dataset contains observational data, calibration files and catalogue information collected from the Mount Stromlo Observatory Facility.</li><li>if applicable: the scope; details of entities being studied or recorded; methodologies used.</li></ul>

#Coverage
simple.field.help.dc-coverage.vivo-DateTimeInterval=Use this to indicate a date range relevant to the research dataset/collection, registry/repository, catalogue or index. Year format requires manual entry, eg. 1990 to 2010
simple.field.help.dc-coverage.redbox-timePeriod=A text description of a time period relating to the coverage of the research dataset/collection, registry/repository, catalogue or index, if applicable, eg. 21st Century, WWII, The Depression, etc.
simple.field.help.dc-coverage.vivo-GeographicLocation=<p> Geospatial location relevant to the research dataset/collection, registry/repository, catalogue or index. This may describe a geographical area where data was collected, a place which is the subject of a collection, or a location which is the focus of an activity, eg. coordinates or placename. </p> <p> You may use the map to select an area, or manually enter a correctly formatted set of coordinates or a value supported by a standard such as a country code, a URL pointing to an XML based description of spatial coverage or free text describing a location. </p> <p> If you wish to generate a map display in Research Data Australia, it is strongly advised that you use <b>DCMI Box</b> for shapes, or <b>DCMI Point</b> for points. </p> <p> Formats supported by the map widget: </p> <ul> <li> <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml" target="_blank">GML</a> - OpenGIS Geography Markup Language (GML) Encoding Standard </li> <li> <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/" target="_blank">KML</a> - Keyhole Markup Language developed for use with Google Earth </li> <li> <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-box" target="_blank">ISO19319dcmiBox</a> - DCMI Box notation derived from bounding box metadata conformant with the iso19139 schema </li> <li> <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-point" target="_blank">DCMIPoint</a> - spatial location information specified in DCMI Point notation </li> </ul> <p> When using the map to input shapes/points, only the above formats are supported. You can use the 'Find location' feature to pan the map to an area you are interested in, but you still need to select a map region to store geospatial data. </p> <p> Formats available for manual data entry: </p> <ul> <li> <a href="http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp" target="_blank">GPX</a> - the GPS Exchange Format </li> <li> <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists.htm" target="_blank">ISO3166</a> - ISO 3166-1 Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions - Part 1: Country codes </li> <li> <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country-codes/background_on_iso_3166/iso_3166-2.htm" target="_blank">ISO31662</a> - Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions - Part 2: Country subdivision codes </li> <li> <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/" target="_blank">kmlPolyCoords</a> - A set of KML long/lat co-ordinates defining a polygon as described by the KML coordinates element </li> <li> <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/" target="_blank">gmlKmlPolyCoords</a> - A set of KML long/lat co-ordinates derived from GML defining a polygon as described by the KML coordinates element but without the altitude component </li> <li> <strong>Text</strong> - free-text representation of spatial location. Use this to record place or region names where geospatial notation is not available. In ReDBox this will search against the Geonames database and return a latitude and longitude value if selected. This will store as a DCMIPoint which in future will display as a point on a Google Map in Research Data Australia. </li> </ul>

#Data Management
simple.field.help.vivo-Location=Record the location of the research data. At least one of the 'URL' or 'Stored At' fields must be entered. The 'Notes' field is optional.
